# Product-Management-System
Application for managing the product with their brands.

# Cab Allocation System
Real time rides can be requested by customers on the system,
which can be accepted by available drivers (who donâ€™t have an ongoing trip). Whichever
driver picks up gets to serve the user. Ride is completed after the customer ends it.

### Further explanation and assumptions:
1. Each customer can request only one ride at a time.
2. Each driver can accept / serve only one ride at a time.
3. Every ride has 3 status - requested, accepted & done.
